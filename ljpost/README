A simple PHP script to post a blog entry into LiveJournal.

The script expects the blog post to be in "markdown" format[1], uses the
excellent PHP markdown script[2] by Michel Fortin to convert the entry to HTML
("markup") and posts to LiveJournal using its XMLRPC interface.

The script uses LiveJournal challenge-response to pass the credentials and does
not transmit passwords in plaintext over the wire.
